# Attendance Monitoring System

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Attendance Monitoring System based on the ESP32 with a DS3231 RTC and the Hitachi HD44780, 16x2 character LCD with a PCF8574 I2C backpack. The system allows users to record attendance using a 4x4 matrix keypad through which Roll Numbers are entered and registered.

This project is designed to automate the process of attendance taking, saving time and reducing errors. With a focus on simplicity and cost-efficiency, it offers a dependable solution for monitoring the attendance in small institutions where advanced methods such as RFID, biometrics, etcâ€¦ are not required.

Refer to the block diagram, PCB layout, schematic, and the code within the repository for detailed explanations and understanding of the project's functionality and hardware connections.
